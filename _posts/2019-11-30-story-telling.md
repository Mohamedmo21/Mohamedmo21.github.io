Story-telling is a big part of user experience. I made a project helping me tell a story about a design created by my group and I. The application used is Adobe Spark. It helped with describing information about a certain topic, or displaying an idea. This can relate to when a designer wants to explain their model. I used the software to help with demonstrating a design for a project within the class. It made it fairly easy to describe my idea in a simple manner.
