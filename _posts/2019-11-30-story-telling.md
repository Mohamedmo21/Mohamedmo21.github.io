  The software had simple but specific instructions on how to build. The app
  allowed for creating slides, changing themes, adding typography and other
  mechanisms. There were restrictions to the application as well. Text was not
  allowed to freely move, it was stuck to one position. It captivated creativity
  for a user which hopefully is changed in later versions.

Story-telling is a big part of user experience. I made a project helping me tell a story about a design created by my group and I. The application used is Adobe Spark. It helped with describing information about a certain topic, or displaying an idea. This can relate to when a designer wants to explain their model. I used the software to help with demonstrating a design for a project within the class. It made it fairly easy to describe my idea in a simple manner.
