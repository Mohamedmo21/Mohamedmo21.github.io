  I used the application Affinity Designer to create this logo. The client is a
  dear friend of mine and does not know anybody in the graphic or user fields. I
  took old designs she had created and added a modern look to add a different
  brand presence. Affinity Designer was very easy to use. All of the functions
  imitate Adobe Illustrator a application used many times in our classes.

One of my clients is my dentist. She is not very technology advanced so she hired me to run her Instagram and be her personal designer for advertising. One of the posts I have created was a re-brand of her logo for younger attraction.
